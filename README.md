An Android app designed to find out instantly which of your friends are able to come to the movies tonight, go out to eat this weekend, or just hangout later today.

Type in a description, date, time, and which of your contacts you're inviting and instantly send off of an invite that your friends can instantly hit "YES" or "NO" to.

Hoping to eventually expand it to support iOS as well as SMS.
